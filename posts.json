    "content": "\n                I came across the concept of digital gardening randomly one day while scrolling through Youtube. I found the concept really interesting and wanted to explore further. I read a few articles to understand it completely and also wrote an article myself. But I didn't actually made my own digital garden till now. Here I am after 3 month working on this again because this concept never truly left my mind. The idea of growing your thoughts and ideas bit by bit and in public was interesting and I want to give it shot. This is the first version of something bigger I'm planning to create in the next few months. \n            ",
